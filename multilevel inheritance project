'''
Runtime polymorphism:
Whenever an object is bound with the functionality at run time, this is known as runtime polymorphism. 
Runtime polymorphism is nothing but method overriding. In Python, method overriding occurs when a derived class provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class.
